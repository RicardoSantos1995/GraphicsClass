Project 2 - Part 3
UID: 109364898

******************
*** BubbleGame ***
******************
Written in XCode on Mac OSX 10.6 Leopard

*** Compiling ***
On OSX:
1) Open .xcodeproj file in XCode.
2) Make sure the OpenGL and GLUT frameworks are included under the project (and not in red). If this is not the case,
right click the project under "Groups & Files" on the left and choose "Add > Existing Frameworks"
3) Choose build and run

On Linux:
1) make
2) ./p2 (MAKE SURE skybox-clouds.bmp is in the local directory!!!)
I created a Makefile that works on OSX and hopefully also on Linux. If it's not working, perhaps I'm not 
including the OpenGL libraries correctly, it should be a quick fix. Please email me at blaw1@umd.edu if you
are having any issues.

*** Gameplay ***
Ball Control:
Use these keys to push the ball. Holding them down will have an extended effect.

  w
a s d
(w) Push forward
(a) Push left
(s) Push back
(d) Push right
(e) Jump up

Zooming:
(i) Zoom in
(o) Zoom out

Camera Control:
Hold down the left click button, and move:
(Left/Right) to control angle.
(Up/Down) to control celevation.

Other:
(q) Quit
(r) Reset

*** Special Features ***
- Ambient, Spotlight, Infinite Spotlight, and a spotlight always over the ball
- "Shadow" above ball that shows the ball X,Y location. I would have put this right on the 
support platform but depth issues caused some problems there.
- Reset button. If you lose the ball, click r to reset.

Enjoy!
