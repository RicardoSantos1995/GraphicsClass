******************
*** BubbleGame ***
******************
Written in XCode on Mac OSX 10.6 Leopard

*** Compiling ***
On OSX:
1) Open .xcodeproj file in XCode.
2) Make sure the OpenGL and GLUT frameworks are included under the project (and not in red). If this is not the case,
right click the project under "Groups & Files" on the left and choose "Add > Existing Frameworks"
3) Choose build and run

On Linux:
1) make
2) ./p1
I created a Makefile that works on OSX and hopefully also on Linux. If it's not working, perhaps I'm not 
including the OpenGL libraries correctly, it should be a quick fix. Please email me at blaw1@umd.edu if you
are having any issues.

*** Gameplay ***
